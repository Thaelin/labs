# Lab 3 - PostGIS

Grading: 3pt

## Setup

Download the docker container as usual

````
docker run -p 5432:5432 fiitpdt/postgis
````

You can safely ignore errors about extension being already present and there are some
constraint validation failures, but don't worry about them.

| Attribute| Value                  |
|----------|------------------------|
| Login    | postgres               |
| Database | gis                    |
| Password | none, leave blank      |
| Spatial reference system | WGS 84 |

Inside the database, you'll find Open Street Map data for a large portion of
Bratislava. More precisely, this extent:

## SQL tricks you might find useful

### Cross joins

You'll be using cross joins (cartesian joins) a lot, because often, there is
no column to join on. The regular join syntax requires an `ON` clausule, so
something like the following is a syntax error:
````
SELECT * FROM planet_osm_line l
  JOIN planet_osm_polygon p 
 WHERE p.name = 'Karlova Ves'
````
Instead, you need to do
````
SELECT * FROM planet_osm_line l 
 CROSS JOIN planet_osm_polygon p
 WHERE p.name = 'Karlova Ves'
````

### `WITH` clausule

When you need to use a subselect, the query can often get very hairy and
unreadable. Alternatively, you can first set up all subqueries and then just
reference them, e.g.:

````
WITH leisure AS (
  SELECT * FROM planet_osm_polygon p
  WHERE leisure IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT SUM(st_area(way)) FROM leisure
````

## Labs

Write queries to answer the following questions:

1. How far (air distance) is FIIT STU from the Bratislava main train station?
   The query should output the distance in meters without any further
   modification.

   *Hint: notice the difference between geometry and geography types in this
   case.*

2. Which other districts are direct neighbours with
   'Karlova Ves'?

3. Which bridges cross over the Danube river?

4. Find the names of all streets in 'Dlhé diely' district.

Optional:

5. What percentage of area of 'Dlhé diely' is available for leisure? (such as
   parks, tennis courts, etc.)

6. In which restaurants can you enjoy a view of the Danube river? Let's say
   that the air distance must be less than 300 meters.

  *Hint: The Danube river is composed of multiple lines and polygons*
